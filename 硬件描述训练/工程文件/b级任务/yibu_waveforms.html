<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file yibu.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo_mixed_widths megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design yibu.vhd.  The design yibu.vhd has a write-side depth of 512 words of 16 bits each. a read-side width of 64. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode.  The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the FIFO under wrfull condition. In the example above, data is written into the FIFO till it is full, then data is read back. </P>
